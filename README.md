# Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
<p> Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_,_] </p> 
<p> Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2. </p>
<p> It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).</p>


# Input: nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2
<p> Output: 5, nums = [0,1,4,0,3,_,_,_] </p>
<p> Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 0, 1, 3, and 4. </p>
<p> Note that the five elements can be returned in any order. </p>
<p> It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores). </p>
